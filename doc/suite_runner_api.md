# The Suite Runner API

This document describes the Javascript API for running tests with Overman. The
API consists of one function. Here's a basic example that runs some tests with
the default spec reporter and uses the default BDD interface:

```javascript
var overman = require('overman');

overman({
  files: ['some.js', 'test.js', 'files.js']
  // More options go here
}).done(function() {
  console.log('Tests completed successfully');
}, function(error) {
  console.error('Tests failed!');
});
```

The suite runner takes a dictionary of options and returns a promise of the
test result. If the promise fails with an `overman.TestFailureError` error, it
means that one or more tests failed. If the promise fails with any other error,
it signifies an internal error in the test runner or a reporter. By default,
information about internal errors are printed to stderr, but this can be
configured with the `internalErrorOutput` option.

## Options

Overman can be configured in a variety of ways by passing options to the suite
runner:

* `files`: Array of paths to suite files to test. *Required*.
* `timeout`: Default test timeout in ms. Defaults to 10000. If 0 is passed, the
  test never times out.
* `listingTimeout`: Timeout for listing tests. Defaults to 60000. If 0 is passed,
  the listing never times out.
* `graceTime`: Time that a test process has to shut down after a timeout (and
  the after hooks are run) before it is hard killed. If 0 is passed, tests are
  hard killed immediately.
* `slowThreshold`: The time, in ms, a test should take to be considered slow.
  Defaults to 1000.
* `interface`: Path to interface file. Optional, the BDD interface is chosen by
  default.
* `interfaceParameter`: Parameter to the interface. Optional, but some
  interfaces may require it.
* `reporters`: Array of reporter objects. Optional, the spec reporter is chosen
  by default.
* `attempts`: Maximum number of times to run a test; if >1 the test will be
  retried on failure. Defaults to 1.
* `parallelism`: Number of tests to run in parallel. Defaults to 8.
* `attributeFilter` (deprecated: use `testFilter`): Function that gets the test attributes as parameters.
  Only tests that returns a truthy value will be run.
* `testFilter`: Function that gets the test object as parameter.
  Only tests that returns a truthy value will be run.
* `grep`: Regex or string. Only tests that match the criteria will be run.
* `invertGrep`: If true, the criteria given to `grep` is inverted.
* `disallowOnly`: Fail if there are tests marked as only. This may be useful to
  set on CI servers, to catch tests mistakenly checked in as only.
* `debugPort`: Enable debugging. This causes Overman to run only one test (the
  first one) and configure the test process for debugging at the specified port.
  This will often be used together with the `debuggerPort` option.
* `internalErrorOutput`: When the suite runner fails with an internal error, it
  writes information about it to this stream. Defaults to stderr
* `runUnstable`: If true, then overman will run all test marked as `unstable`.
* `killSubProcesses`: If true, then overman will kill all subprocesses spawned by
  the test. A SIGKILL will be triggered for each process in the tree when the test
  has finished. There could be an issue that the subprocess does not get the chance
  of cleaning up so that has to be done synchrously before the test finishes.
  SIGKILL was choosen since its supported by the platforms used.

## Cancelling the test runner

The suite runner supports cancellation. This is useful to do for example as a
response to the `SIGINT` signal. Cancellation is done by calling `cancel` on the
promise that is returned from the suite runner function.

Here's an example of how this can be used:

```javascript
var overman = require('overman');

var suitePromise = overman({ files: process.argv.slice(1) });

process.on('SIGINT', function() {
  suitePromise.cancel();
});

suitePromise.done(function() {}, function(err) {
  process.exit(1);
});
```
